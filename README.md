# 🔐 Secure Vault Lite

Secure Vault Lite is a simple, browser-based document encryption tool built for secure file handling without needing a backend server.

It allows users to:
- Upload text-based files
- Encrypt them in-browser using AES encryption
- Download the encrypted version
- Decrypt files on demand with a password

This project demonstrates lightweight frontend cryptography using `CryptoJS`, ideal for secure communications, field-level document handling, and offline storage.
